#While matrices are confined to two dimensions, arrays can be of 
#any number of dimensions. The array function takes a dim attribute 
#which creates the required number of dimension. In the below example 
#we create an array with two elements which are 3x3 matrices each.
#Create an array
a<- array(c('green','yellow'), dim=c(3,3,2))
print(a)
