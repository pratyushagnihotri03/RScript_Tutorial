#Data frames are tabular data objects. Unlike a matrix in data frame each column 
#can contain different modes of data. The first column can be numeric while the 
#second column can be character and third column can be logical. It is a list 
#of vectors of equal length.
#Data Frames are created using the data.frame() function.

# Create the data frame.
